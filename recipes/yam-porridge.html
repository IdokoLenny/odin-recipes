    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>This recipe is amazing I would freeze the leftover in slab meals on a cookie sheet them vacuum seal them once they are frozen. This way it will be perfect warmed up. It can stay in the freezer for up to 5 month and taste the same as I put it in.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 Â½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
